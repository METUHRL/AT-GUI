% Usage:
%        TActivation = ActivationTime(potvals, geom);
%
% Inputs:
%   potvals     Time varying potential values for leads (size: (m x n) m: number of leads, n: number of time instance)
%   geom        Heart surface geometry. Must include triangle information geom.fac (size: (3 x numOfTri);
%               node indexing should start with 1, not 0)
%
% Output:
%   TActivation  Activation time vector (size: m x 1):


% Find first order neighbours of the each measurement point on the surface
[m, ~] = size(potvals);
neighbours = build_nbours(geom.fac, m);

% For each measurement point calculate the activation time delays between
% its first order neighbours
